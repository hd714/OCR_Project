Lunsumio-Polivy demonstrated a 59% risk reduction for progression or death (11.5 vs. 3.8 months), doubled the CR rate (51.4% vs. 24.3%) and
improved the ORR by 30% compared with R-GemOx (70.3% vs. 40.0%)
SUNMO is the first positive Phase IIl trial combining a bispecific antibody and ADC without conventional chemotherapy in DLBLC
Lunsumio+Polivy has the lowest CRS incidence and severity among T-cell directed therapies to date and thus may be suitable for outpatient use
